# loz-js

This is me playing around with JS so I can create a Legend of Zelda of my own.

This is part learning how to use JS, and part showing off. Lol.

I followed a tutorial on YouTube, by EZGameDev.

I plan to continue this project after I finish the tutorial and build the entire game this way.
